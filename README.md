This repository contains the mininum requirements for defining a container, building and running an application. At this point, this is just an instantiation of get-started documentation (part 2) on the docker website.  The purpose is simply to be able to get this together more quickly to test whether docker is working correctly a system (e.g. DSVM).

See docker website for more info: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/
